            On the Internet, the space we live in is the website we visit. 
            Regarding the spatial transitions mentioned by Georges, what I 
            understand is that people jump to different web pages by clicking 
            on different links.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Internet reaches a global audience of anyone who has access to 
            the Internet, and there is only one threshold for such a "space" to 
            be realized: an Internet connection. In the Internet world, people 
            do not need to care about the distance, and in many cases, all they 
            need to do is click to enter a new space. Therefore, there are very 
            few limitations of the Internet. The Internet gives people a window 
            to the world, and people around the globe can contact each other or 
            learn information about various places on the earth through the Internet.

            <br>
            However, on the Internet, there are different policies in different 
            countries, so not every country can access some sites. From the reading 
            the author mentioned that Google is not available in China, for myself, 
            when I returned to China, I cannot access a lot of websites about my school, 
            and I cannot even use my school mailbox properly. Therefore, we would connect 
            to a VPN to help me access some websites. It's like the websites are covered 
            with a thick wall so that we can't access and browse them directly.
            <br>
            <br>
            When people use the Internet, the user's geographic location is also displayed. 
            IP Address is to show the geographic location of a person when they are using 
            the Internet.

        <p class="Q">
            -Does the Internet have a global reach or is it decentralized from a single point?
            <br>
            <br>
            -As the Internet is a shared public space, are users' private information protected
            while browsing the Internet? Or what are the threats to private information?
